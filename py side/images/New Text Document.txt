As far as I understand, the problem is that tensorflow graphs and sessions are not thread safe. So by default a new session (which does not contain any previously loaded weights, models a.s.o.) is created for each thread, i.e. for each request. By saving the global session that contains all your models and setting it to be used by keras in each thread the problem is solved.
